| Problem | In this digital age, social media has become a part of everyday life. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube allow individuals to interact, share information and voice their opinions with ease. However, behind the convenience and benefits offered by social media, there are threats that need to be addressed. One of the serious problems that arise is the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on social media has significant negative impacts on both individuals and society as a whole. Psychologically, victims of hate speech often experience emotional stress and deep psychological trauma, which can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety and reduce their self-confidence and self-esteem. Socially, hate speech can reinforce negative stereotypes and discrimination against certain groups. The spread of hate speech can also cause polarisation and division in society, creating a disharmonious environment and triggering tension and conflict between different groups. Therefore, it is necessary to detect hate speech to prevent its further spread. Early detection and handling of hate speech on social media is crucial to maintaining individual psychological well-being and social harmony in society. |
| Machine learning solutions | Create a model to detect messages containing hate speech. This model will be used to identify and classify messages that contain hate speech, thus enabling social media platforms to immediately take the necessary precautions. |
| Processing method | Data processing begins with encoding on Offensive 0 for False and 1 for True, then upsampling on minor data, namely 0 (False) so that the data becomes balanced, on the Transform component normalize the conversion of uppercase letters to lowercase letters and on the Trainer with standardize ‘lower_and_strip_punctuation’ to remove punctuation marks. |
| Arsitektur model | The model consists of several layers, namely, input to receive data, TextVectorisation to convert text into numerical values that can be processed by the model, Embedding to create sequences, GlobalAveragePooling to reduce dimensions, Dense to process features, and output to produce classification. |
| Evaluation metrics | The metrics used in this project are Area Under Curve to calculate the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, False Positive for many classifications of negative data as positive, False Negative for many classifications of positive data as negative, True Positive for many classifications that are positive, True Negative for many classifications that are negative, and Binary Accuracy to measure the proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions made by the model in a binary classification problem. |
| Model performance | In the Traing process of the stored model, the bainary_accuracy of 0.9413 and val_binary_accuracy of 0.52312 are obtained, indicating that there is overfitting in the training data, so further adjustments to the model are needed. |
| Deployment options | The deployment stage will be done using Railway, Railway is a deployment platform that allows developers to easily deploy applications, including machine learning models, to production environments. |
| Web app | Access the model with [hate-speech-model](https://system-development-and-operation.up.railway.app/v1/models/hate-speech-model/metadata) (Model inactive due to resource limitations) |
| Monitoring | Monitoring with Prometheus allows monitoring various aspects of the machine learning model, such as the number of requests received. |
